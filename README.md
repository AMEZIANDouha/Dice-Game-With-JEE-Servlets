## 1. Project Overview

The "Dice Game With JEE Servlets" project demonstrates the use of Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) technologies to create a dynamic web application. This project involves implementing a dice game where users can play and track their scores. The application uses JPA for database interactions, JSP for the front-end, and servlets, controllers, and filters to manage the game logic and user interactions.

## 2. Key Objectives


###### Dynamic Web Application:
Develop a dynamic web application using JEE technologies.
Provide a seamless and engaging user experience for playing the dice game.

###### Data Persistence:
Utilize JPA for efficient and reliable data persistence.
Ensure data integrity and consistency across different sessions and users.

###### MVC Architecture:
Implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
Use servlets as controllers, JSP for views, and JPA entities as models.

###### User Authentication and Authorization:
Implement user authentication and authorization using filters.
Ensure secure access to game functionalities and user data.

## 3. Technologies Used

- Java EE
- JPA (Java Persistence API)
- JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- Servlets
- Controllers
- Filters
- Maven
- MySQL 

## 4. Methodology

The project employs a structured approach to develop the dice game application, leveraging JEE technologies for a robust and scalable solution. The following steps outline the methodology:

###### Project Setup:
Set up the project structure using Maven for dependency management.
Configure the web.xml file for servlet mapping and filter configurations.

###### Data Modeling:
Define JPA entities for the game data, such as users, games, and scores.
Set up the database schema and configure the persistence unit.

###### Game Logic:
Implement servlets to handle game logic, including dice rolls, score calculations, and game state management.
Use controllers to manage user requests and interactions.

###### User Interface:
Design JSP pages for the game interface, user registration, login, and score display.
Incorporate CSS and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive UI.

###### Filters and Security:
Implement filters for user authentication and authorization.
Ensure secure access to game functionalities based on user roles.

###### Testing and Validation:
Test the application thoroughly to ensure correctness and robustness.
Validate user inputs, handle exceptions, and ensure data integrity.
## 5. Key Components
###### Data Collection:
Set up a relational database to store user and game data.
Use JPA to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations.

###### Game Logic:
Develop servlets to manage game operations and user interactions.
Implement business logic for the dice game, including rules, score calculations, and game state management.

###### User Interface:
Create JSP pages for user interaction, game play, and score display.
Incorporate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a dynamic and responsive front-end.

###### Security:
Implement filters for user authentication and authorization.
Ensure secure handling of user data and access control based on roles.
